# Game facts (Dungeons of Sundaria, Steam 587520)

Verify any offset with `scripts/sdk.py` before relying on it — a game patch moves them.

exe: Archon/Binaries/Win64/Archon-Win64-Shipping.exe     # Steam launches it directly; no root launcher
platform_for_mods: Windows build via Proton (native Linux build cannot load DLL mods)
launch_option: WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winmm=n,b" %command%     # winmm.dll = Ultimate ASI Loader v9.7.4 (official dinput8.dll renamed)

read_paths:   # all plain memory reads, safe from the render thread
  world: UWorld::GetWorld() → Levels[i] → Actors[j]
  local_player: World → OwningGameInstance → LocalPlayers[0] → PlayerController (→ Pawn)
  characters: actor IsA AArchonCharacter (: ACharacter : APawn); 107 subclasses in dump, every enemy/boss/player
  is_player: APawn::PlayerState != null
  health: AArchonCharacter::mAbilitySystemComponent → SpawnedAttributes[] → IsA UArchonAttributeSet_Status → CurrentHealth (float)
  max_health: UArchonAttributeSet_Secondary::Health @0x30   # status: unverified at runtime; fallback = peak CurrentHealth seen
  position: RootComponent->RelativeLocation = capsule center (root unattached ⇒ relative == world)
  camera: PlayerController → PlayerCameraManager → CameraCachePrivate.POV {Location, Rotation, FOV(horizontal)}

  server_simulated: write to EVERY player character; in co-op the host's values win, clients get corrected
  unknown: whether abilities/dodge reset these each frame

combat_log (unused so far; crits + own-vs-party damage):
  delegates: AArchonCharacter::OnCombatLogGeneratedDelegate_Offense / _Defense
  payload: FCombatDetailDamage {FinalDamage, BlockedDamage, CritLevel, ResistedDamage, MitigatedDamage_Armor, bIsHeal}
  cost: needs a ProcessEvent/delegate hook on the game thread, not the Present hook

damage_numbers_source_today: per-frame CurrentHealth diff (core/combat.hpp) → cannot tell whose hit or crits
